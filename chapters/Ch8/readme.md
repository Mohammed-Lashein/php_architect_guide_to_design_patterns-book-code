# Notes about iterators

## LibraryReleasedIterator
The iterator works, but I don't like our implementation of sorting the `collection`.
We are using `usort`, which sorts the array in place.
But following immutability principles, we should create a copy of the array and sort it instead.

So, I asked claude for some help and here is a good suggestion: 
> store a copy of the `$this->collection`, then apply `usort` to it
```php
$this->storeItems = $this->collection;
```

But wait a minute. In js, arrays are passed by reference by default, so we are still breaking immutability like so.   
**This is not the case in php**. Quoting [from the docs](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.types.array.php), (Example #31 Array Copying): 
> Array assignment always involves value copying. Use the reference operator `&` to copy an array by reference.

So in php, the default is value copying unlike js.

## Classes thoughts
After finishing the chapter, it seems that we have a LOT of classes and the code became more complex. So, it is important to list each class responsibilities for easier maintenance: 

1. `ForeachableLibrary`: Instead of directly calling the iterator in a `while` loop as we did at the beginning of the chapter, we will be able to directly loop over the library in a `foreach` loop.  
How will we do that ? ðŸ¤”  
Our `ForeachableLibrary` *implements* `Iterator` interface, that's why we will be able to loop over it directly in the `foreach` loop.

1. `PolymorphicForeachableLibrary`: Allows us to define what iterator type we want to use.  
How are we able to loop over `$this->lib` instance directly in the `foreach` loop? ðŸ¤”  
Because `PolymorphicForeachableLibrary` also *implements* `Iterator` interface

1. `StandardLibraryIterator`: It has the methods required by the `Iterator` interface.
But why doesn't `StandardLibraryIterator` implement `Iterator` interface explicitly in the code?  
Because we want to be able to loop over `$this->lib` instead of getting the iterator from it and looping through the iterator in the `foreach` loop (Although there is a better solution to be explained later)

### Separation of concerns notice 
Instead of mixing concerns, we can make `ForeachableLibrary` and `PolymorphicForeachableLibrary` implement `IteratorAggregate` instead of `Iterator` interface. By doing so, the previously 2 mentioned classes won't need to have the iterator methods required by the `Iterator` interface, but instead they will delegate that responsibility to an iterator we choose.

The updated implementation: 
```php
class StandardLibraryIterator implements Iterator {}
class ForeachableLibrary extends Library implements IteratorAggregate {
  // this method is required by the IteratorAggregate interface
  public function getIterator(): Iterator {
    $type = $this->iterator_type;
    $classNameWithNamespace = __NAMESPACE__ . '\\' . $type;
    return new $classNameWithNamespace($this->collection);
  }
}
// same should happen for `PolymorphicForeachableLibrary`
```
Usage of the classes after separation of concerns: 
```php
$library = new PolymorphicForeachableLibrary();
$library->setIteratorType('released');

// This works because IteratorAggregate makes it foreachable
foreach ($library as $item) {
  echo "$item->name \n";
}

// You can also get the iterator directly if needed
$iterator = $library->getIterator();
```
Note that if you choose to follow the above approach, you will need to remove `Library::getIterator(): Iterator` because it returns our custom `Iterator`, which happens to have the same name as the `Iterator` interface, so it is causing a conflict with `IteratorAggregate` which expects our `getIterator()` method to return a `Transversable` (an abstract base interface).
