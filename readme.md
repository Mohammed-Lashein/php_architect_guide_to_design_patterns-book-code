Some php functions to know: 
- `current()`: returns the value of the array element that's currently being pointed to by the array pointer.
- `reset()`: resets the internal pointer of an array to the **first** element and returns the value of the first array element.
- `next()`: Advances the internal pointer of an array to the next element AND return the value of that element
