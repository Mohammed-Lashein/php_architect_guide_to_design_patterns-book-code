# What is this repo for?
This is my second attempt to learn from this book (php architect's guide to design patterns). The [first attempt](https://github.com/Mohammed-Lashein/scandiweb-BE-prototype) was a couple of months ago. The problem with the aforementioned repository is that it had several concerns, and it was cluttered with a lot of noise.

But this repository just focuses on this book's code as a reference for both Design Patterns and TDD.
